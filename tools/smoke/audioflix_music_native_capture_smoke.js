// Music -> native EveOS bridge: no play->sound lag, and a STABLE stream (no cut-outs).
//
// The bridge plays from a bounded queue drained by a device callback: an empty queue emits
// silence (audible cut-outs), a full one drops its oldest chunk. Capture runs at exactly 1x
// realtime, so this controller builds a cushion before its first send and then pumps chunks
// strictly in order.
//
// Asserts: (a) the native music route never pre-decodes the track (that was the lag),
// (b) local speakers are silenced while the route owns the audio, (c) nothing is sent until the
// prebuffer cushion is built, (d) once streaming, chunks are sent strictly sequentially (never
// overlapping/out of order), (e) the device stream is pre-warmed so the first chunks aren't
// clipped by a cold open, (f) stop tears the tap down and restores local output.
